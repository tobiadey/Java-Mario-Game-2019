To open my project go to SRC

HOW TO PLAY GAME

Click to create balls, if balls hits Mario then mario's lives decrement by 1. Mario has 2 lives for each level, the aim is to get the lives count to 0, while in each level there is a certain  total amount of coins you have to collect to be allowed to go to the next level.


Press Q to quit game, only before you complete the level

Press S to save  game level, coin count and lives count

Press R to load game level, coincount and lives count.
(IMPORTANT I was not able to get coin count and lives count to load, but I was able to get level to load)

Press 1 to increase volume
Press 2 to default volume
Press 3 to decrease volume
